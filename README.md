Hi!

Thank you for taking the time to review my submission. I explain the app in detail in my demo but there is one thing to note:

If you would like to test the app out, you will need paste your APIKey in the Constants struct in the APIClient in the `static let apiKey` field.
I removed the apiKey for security since this is a public repository
